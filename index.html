                    Since the dawn of time, humans have relied 
                    heavily on nature for resources to thrive and 
                    continue to grow as a society and as a nation. But 
                    as of the last few hundred years, humans have 
                    started to abuse nature and ruin the balance that 
                    has been upheld for thousands of years. This took a 
                    sharp rise at the start of the industrial revolution 
                    due to the fumes being released. After the 
                    revolution, the world saw a large increase in 
                    population and an increase in living standards, 
                    results in the depletion of resources. The usage of 
                    different types of fuels and chemicals in factories 
                    resulted in increased air and water pollution along 
                    with an increase in the usage of fossil fuels. Then 
                    the 20th century rolls along and brings with it 
                    many inventions. The inventions weren’t exactly 
                    energy efficient, but they worked. It also brought 
                    along plenty of ways to minimize fuel emissions. As 
                    time went on, people decided to find new ways to 
                    optimize inventions and minimize emissions. It’s 
                    not perfect just yet, but we’ll get there soon 
                    hopefully. Of course, you can also do your part, by 
                    managing electricity and heating in your home and 
                    workplace. You can also make sure to use public 
                    transport to minimize the emissions of fossil fuels. 
                    Also, by taking shorter showers, you can lower the 
                    burning of fossil fuels.<br> <br>
